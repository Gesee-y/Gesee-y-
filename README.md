## About Me

I'm a fairly regular developer who enjoys low-level programming, optimizations, and other related topics.  
I'm 18 years old and currently in my first year at the **National Advanced School of Engineering of Yaoundé**, studying Digital Humanities.  
I started coding at 15, mainly because I loved games and wanted to create some myself.

## My Languages 

- Julia (my primary language)
- Rust
- Nim
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## My Main Achievements

- **[ReactiveECS.jl](https://github.com/Gesee-y/ReactiveECS.jl)**: The fastest and most flexible ECS in Julia, built with reactive pipelines and a database-like storage model.
- **[Cruise.jl](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Cruise.jl)**: A game engine built entirely from scratch. I also developed the **[rendering engine](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Horizons.jl)**, **[physics engine](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Interactions.jl)**, **[audio engine](https://github.com/Gesee-y/WavesFlow.jl)**, and more.
- A complete **[Undertale engine](https://github.com/Gesee-y/xxxxtale)** built on Godot 4, designed with clean code principles in mind, SOLID principles, and composition over inheritance.
- **[Numerous LeetCode problems](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Leetcode-challenge)** solved in Rust, demonstrating my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- And much more — feel free to explore my repositories.
